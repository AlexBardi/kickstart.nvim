Add [count] to the number of alphabetical character in the highlighted text. If several lines are highlighted, each one will be incremented by an additonal [count]. (so effectively creating [count] incrementing sequence) .

1.
1.
1.
Move to the second "1." and Visually select three lines, pressing g CTRL-A results in :
1.
2.
